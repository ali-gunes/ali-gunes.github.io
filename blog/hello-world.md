### ***Every fine journey has to start somewhere.*** 
<!--more-->
It's been about 2 months now since I started to learn Data Science and in these 2 months I believe I figured what future-Ali should do. He should mess with **Data**!

So It's decided; I am learning Data, I am building my career on Data, I am determined to be a Data Scientist, and there is just one thing left:

---
* I should blog my Data Science journey :)
---

I said
 
> Ali, while I am learning to speak with Data, I should make some kind of blog series about my Data Science journey so I can follow my progress a lot more easier and have a well structured source to look at whenever I need.

... and here I am.

As It's obvious now, I will be posting what I learned about Data Science to here. 
I can only hope to finish what I've started.
